# Collaborative Canvas - Deployment Files

## What gets deployed
- `dist/server/` - Compiled TypeScript server code
- `dist/server/public/` - Built client assets (HTML, CSS, JS)

## Build process
1. `tsc` compiles server TypeScript to `dist/server/`
2. `vite build` bundles client to `dist/client/`
3. `copy-client` script moves `dist/client/` → `dist/server/public/`

## Why this structure?
- Server serves static files from `dist/server/public/` in production
- Single deployable artifact: just the `dist/` folder
- WebSocket and HTTP on same origin (no CORS issues)
